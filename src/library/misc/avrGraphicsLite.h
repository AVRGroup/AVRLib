    @typedef ARGL_CONTEXT_SETTINGS_REF
    @abstract Opaque type to hold ARGL settings for a given OpenGL context.
    @discussion
		An OpenGL context is an implementation-defined structure which
		keeps track of OpenGL state, including textures and display lists.
		Typically, individual OpenGL windows will have distinct OpenGL
		contexts assigned to them by the host operating system.

		As gsub_lite uses textures and display lists, it must be able to
		track which OpenGL context a given texture or display list it is using
		belongs to. This is especially important when gsub_lite is being used to
		draw into more than one window (and therefore more than one context.)

		Basically, functions which depend on OpenGL state, will require an
		ARGL_CONTEXT_SETTINGS_REF to be passed to them. An ARGL_CONTEXT_SETTINGS_REF
		is generated by setting the current OpenGL context (e.g. if using GLUT,
		you might call glutSetWindow()) and then calling arglSetupForCurrentContext().
		When you have finished using ARGL in a given context, you should call
		arglCleanup(), passing in an ARGL_CONTEXT_SETTINGS_REF, to free the
		memory used by the settings structure.

		This function performs required setup of the gsub_lite library

		functions are called for this context.

		An OpenGL context holds all of the state of the OpenGL machine, including
		textures and display lists etc. There will usually be one OpenGL context
		for each window displaying OpenGL content.

		Other argl*() functions whose operation depends on OpenGL state will
		require an ARGL_CONTEXT_SETTINGS_REF. This is just so that

		You should call arglCleanup() passing in the ARGL_CONTEXT_SETTINGS_REF

    @discussion
		This function draws an image from an ARVideo source to the current
		OpenGL context. This operation is most useful in video see-through
		augmented reality applications for drawing the camera view as a
		background image, but can also be used in other ways.

		An undistorted image is drawn with the lower-left corner of the
		bottom-left-most pixel at OpenGL screen coordinates (0,0), and the
		upper-right corner of the top-right-most pixel at OpenGL screen
		coodinates (x * zoom, y * zoom), where x and y are the values of the
		fields cparam->xsize and cparam->ysize (see below) and zoom is the
		value of the parameter zoom (also see below). If cparam->dist_factor
		indicates that an un-warping correction should be applied, the actual
		coordinates will differ from the values specified here.

		OpenGL state: Drawing is performed with depth testing and lighting
		disabled, and thus leaves the the depth buffer (if any) unmodified. If
		pixel transfer is by texturing (see documentation for arglDrawMode),
		the drawing is done in replacement texture environment mode.
		The depth test enable and lighting enable state and the texture
		environment mode are restored before the function returns.
	@param image Pointer to the tightly-packed image data (as returned by
		arVideoGetImage()). The horizontal and vertical dimensions of the image
		data must exactly match the values specified in the fields cparam->xsize
		and cparam->ysize (see below).

		The first byte of image data corresponds to the first component of the
		top-left-most pixel in the image. The data continues with the remaining
		pixels of the first row, followed immediately by the pixels of the second
		row, and so on to the last byte of the image data, which corresponds to
		the last component of the bottom-right-most pixel.
	@param cparam Pointer to a set of ARToolKit camera parameters for the
		current video source. The size of the source image is taken from the
		fields xsize and ysize of the ARParam structure pointed to. Also, when
		the draw mode is AR_DRAW_BY_TEXTURE_MAPPING (see the documentation for
		the global variable arglDrawMode) the field dist_factor of the ARParam
		structure pointed to will be taken as the amount to un-warp the supplied
		image.
	@param zoom The amount to scale the video image up or down. To draw the video
		image double size, use a zoom value of 2.0. To draw the video image
		half size use a zoom value of 0.5.
	@param contextSettings A reference to ARGL's settings for the current OpenGL
		context, as returned by arglSetupForCurrentContext() for this context. It
		is the callers responsibility to make sure that the current context at the
		time arglDisplayImage() is called matches that under which contextSettings
